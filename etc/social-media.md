# Social media

You may be tasked to engage social media. E.g. addressing user feedback, raising awareness, doing market research, creating publications, etc.

Instead of managing company-accounts or other forms of public facades we encourage you to deliver the message with your own unique touch but also expect that you do so in a professional and responsible manner.
