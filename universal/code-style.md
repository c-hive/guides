# Code style guide

## Paradigms

- Clean Code. This phrase is often thrown around but here it refers to the book and video series of Robert C. Martin (a.k.a. uncle Bob).
- [Yagni](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html) (You Aren't Gonna Need It)


## Code style

- Code style in projects is unified, using a common linter and style guide.
- Comments in code are avioded and used only in exceptional cases.


## Commit messages

- [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams


## Branches

- use snake case
- include issue tracker reference (e.g. `issue#4-add_something`, `CH-123-add_something`, `no_issue-add_something`)


### Special files

- Repos contain a README file and a COPYRIGHT or LICENSE file.


## Documentation

- The README gets newcommers up to speed and contains instructions on how to setup the development environment
