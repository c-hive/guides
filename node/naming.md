# Naming

##### File naming

The following file naming convention is just a suggestion:
- *controllers:* <file_name>.**controller**.js,
- *models:* <file_name>.**model**.js,
- *routes:* <file_name>.**route**.js.

##### Casing

- There are three different approaches to declare variable and file names.
- Which one is preferable for you?
    - *snake_case*,
    - *lowerCamelCase*,
    - *UpperCamelCase*.
- I'd stay with the *UpperCamelCase* in the backend both for the file and variable names, but it depends on you as well.
