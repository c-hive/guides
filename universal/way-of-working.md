# Way of Working

## Tools

These are configured for each project. They might differ on project-to-project basis.

GitHub is better for open source projects because of reach. GitLab seems better for private projects because of the bigger selection of tightly integrated services (therefore less security point of failures) and pricing.

We're currently still in the GitHub universe with every project.

### Development platform
- GitHub
- GitLab

### Issue tracking
- Dev platform's issue tracker
- Keep decisions and (excerpts of) technical discussion in the issues

### Time tracking
- Record time spent on the issue before closing, dev platform might also offer features for it
- Record total time spent (also referencing issues) in a shared space, optionally [Clockify](https://clockify.me/)

### Communication:
- Slack
- Secondary, mainly for voice: discord, facebook

### CI
- CircleCI for GitHub
- built-in CI for GitLab
