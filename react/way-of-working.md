# React / Way of Working

## Tools

### Code quality:
- ESLint and Stylelint for linting
- Prettier for formatting
- Codecov for coverage

## Development workflow

### Pre-commit hooks

Use the [pre-commit](https://github.com/observing/pre-commit) package. Hooks can be bypassed if needed via `--no-verify`.
