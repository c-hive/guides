# Universal code style guide


## Code style

In most general terms: follow Clean Code. This phrase is often thrown around but here it refers to the book and video series of Robert C. Martin (a.k.a. uncle Bob). This is a useful read / binge if you haven't already.

- Code style in projects is unified, using a common linter and style guide.
- Comments in code are avioded and used only in exceptional cases.


## Commit messages

- [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) by Chris Beams
- Use backticks (\`) to refer to `code`


## Branches

- use snake case
- are prefixed with issue number and a dash, e.g. `issue#4-create_comething_fancy`


## File structure and naming

- Names should be simple, clear and intuitive
- Follow language/framework specific guides


### Special files

- Repos contain a README file and a COPYRIGHT or LICENSE file.


## Documentation

- The README gets newcommers up to speed and helps them get the app up & running
